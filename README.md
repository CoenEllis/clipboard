# clipboard
A Python program to track clipboard history and paste from history using custom keybinds.

## How it works
- Watches your clipboard for new text (delay can be changed via paramater)
- Saves it to a JSON file
- Lets you paste previous items with hotkeys. For example, ctrl + shift + 1 will paste the 2nd to last item you copied
